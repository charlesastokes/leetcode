    "# Leet Code Easy Problem in a Java Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "While practicing leetcode I thought it would be fun to try using a Java Kernel for notebooks. The purpose is to use the REPL style environment notebooks offer (executing code line by line) combined with Markdown cells, to better communicate my thoughts and solutions. I felt visually this is a better way to share leetcode solutions than `.java` files with a large amount of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, I explore some options to embed JUnits in a notebook, although as you can see below I find that JUnits in their typical format, for example test suites, aren't really philosophically in alignment with visual notebooks and REPL environments, although more work could be done to make the solution more seamless.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that unsurprisingly Java Kernels aren't well supported. The Jupyter project links out to a few. None that I could find have a large open source community behind them, and many haven't been updated in years. The most recently updated project, which I decided to experiment with after reading through the code is the Rapaio Kernel.\n",

    "The initial naive solution involves a quadratic runtime comparison of all possible heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a double nested for loop at first glance seemed like a simple way to implement the problem, it misses out on an important optimization. Some heights can be ignored in the second loop, since we are trying to maximize the area. This can't be solved by first sorting the heights, since the width is determined based on the distance between relative placement of the heights in the array. While there may be some very advanced techniques to do this sort of sorting, it wouldn't be feasible for a leetcode assignment where time is of the essence, and it likely wouldn't be as memory or compute efficient ultimately. This is where the **two pointer** method shines. \n"
